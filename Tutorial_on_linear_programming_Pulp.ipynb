    "### Linear Programming and integer programming are widely used techniques in the field of diceret optimization. They generally dominates all the sectors like bussiness, finance, autmobiles transportation etc... Due to its wide applicablity, it is necessary to know how to model the problems of linear programming and how we can solve it using modern softwares and technologies. This tutorial will be basically on modelling of linear and non linear programming and how to solve it. \n",
